# tic-tac-toe-js

## Summary 

Tic-tac-toe game using vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. Human can play against an AI (that always goes second). Tried to implement a version of minimax but without alpha-beta pruning. Need to come back and refactor the code to have a cleaner implementation of minimax so that alpha-beta pruning can also be implemented.
